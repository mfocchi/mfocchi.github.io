Michele Focchi is currently a Researcher at the DLS team in IIT. He received both the Bsc. and the Msc. in Control System Engineering from Politecnico di Milano. After gaining some $R\&D$ experience in the industry, in 2009 he joined IIT where he developed a micro-turbine for which he obtained an international patent. 
In 2013, he got a PhD  in robotics, getting involved in the Hydraulically Actuated Quadruped Robot project. 
He initially was developing torque controllers for locomotion purposes, subsequently he moved to higher level (whole-body) controllers and model identification. 
He was also investigating locomotion strategies that are robust to uncertainties an work reliably on the real platform. Currently his research interests are focused on pushing the performances of quadruped 
robots in traversing unstructured environments, by using optimization-based planning strategies to perform dynamic planning. He published more than 35 papers in international journals and 
conferences and supervised several master and one PhD and thesis.
